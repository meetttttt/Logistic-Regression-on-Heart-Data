Logistic Regression on Heart Data
Here I have first mentioned what the WorkFlow is (How we will start our project)
Then we need is the library so import it 
Then we load our data using pandas function
Then we move to Preprocing part of the data
As our data is read to process first we will split it into trianing and testing phase
Then we Visualize the training data 
Then we create our model
Fit the data
Now Lets check accuracy
Here I have Performed Logistic Regression on Heart Data and got 85% accuracy
